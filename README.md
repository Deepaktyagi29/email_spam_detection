1️⃣ Project Objective:
"The goal of my project was to build a machine learning system that can automatically detect whether an email or SMS message is spam or not. This helps prevent users from receiving unwanted or malicious messages."

2️⃣ Dataset:
"I used the SMS Spam Collection dataset, which contains over 5,500 messages labeled as 'spam' or 'ham' (not spam). The dataset is widely used for spam detection tasks and provides a good balance for training and testing models."

3️⃣ Data Preprocessing:
"I first cleaned the text data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters. Then, I tokenized the messages to split them into words, which allows the model to understand the content. This step is crucial for converting raw text into a format suitable for machine learning."

4️⃣ Feature Extraction:
"I used Bag-of-Words via CountVectorizer to convert the text into numerical features. This creates a matrix showing the frequency of each word in the dataset, which is then used by the model to learn patterns that distinguish spam from ham."

5️⃣ Model Selection:
"For this project, I used Multinomial Naïve Bayes because it is very effective for text classification and spam detection. It works on the principle of conditional probability, assuming words are independent within a message, which is suitable for this type of problem."

6️⃣ Training & Evaluation:
"I split the dataset into training and testing sets with an 80-20 split. After training the model, I evaluated it using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model achieved 98% accuracy, with a precision of 0.96 and recall of 0.92 for the spam class."

7️⃣ Challenges & Improvements:
"The main challenge was class imbalance because spam messages were fewer than ham messages. I handled this by careful evaluation and considering metrics like precision and recall. In future, the model could be improved using TF-IDF or deep learning models like LSTM for better context understanding."

8️⃣ Outcome:
"Overall, the project successfully detects spam with high accuracy and can be extended into a real-time application using a web interface like Streamlit or Flask."
